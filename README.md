##### Frick Collection
###### smallest paragraph
The Frick is one of the preeminent small art museums in the United States, with a high-quality collection of old master paintings and fine furniture housed in nineteen galleries of varying size within the former residence. **Frick had intended the mansion to become a museum eventually**, and a few of the paintings are still arranged according to Frick's design. **Besides its permanent collection**, the Frick has always organized small, focused temporary exhibitions.

 This is testing __FRICK'S DESIGN__
